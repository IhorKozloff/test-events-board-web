# About project.
The project interacts with a server that falls asleep from time to time. On your first visit you will have to wait a bit.
The server files can be found at the link here [BackEnd Repo](https://github.com/IhorKozloff/test-events-board-backend)

  The project was completed according to the following requirements:
  - Project has Events Page - receives data from the server and renders it. The page has a panel for sorting data; the sorting itself is performed on the server.
    There is also pagination, which is performed in the form of dynamic loading of data by scrolling.
  - Event Details Page - receives extended data on the event ID, information is displayed on the page including registered users.
  - Register Page - The page is a user registration form for a specific event. Validation was performed on the client and server parts of the project.
